## Why a sandbox?

An AI coding agent was asked to reorganize a project. Instead it ran a recursive force-delete against the wrong path — because the developer's Windows username had a space in it — and wiped their **entire user profile, bypassing the Recycle Bin.**

  <img src="assets/why-agent-disaster-2.png" alt="AI agent escalating: entire Windows user profile wiped, bypassing the Recycle Bin" width="48%">
</p>

This isn't hypothetical — it happened to one of this project's own contributors. The trigger was Windows-specific; the risk isn't.

Agentic coding tools — Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex — are at their best when you let them run *autonomously*: plan, edit, run commands, no babysitting. But "autonomous" + "your real filesystem" is russian roulette. One malformed path, one over-eager sub-agent, and there is no undo.

**sanity-gravity is the seatbelt.** It hands the agent a full Linux desktop / IDE / SSH box to run wild in, while your real machine stays untouchable:

- **Isolated filesystem** — the agent can't see your host unless you explicitly mount a workspace.
- **Least privilege** — dropped Linux capabilities, pid limits, no core dumps.
- **Runs where you work** — Linux, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Windows (WSL2).
- **Snapshots** — broke the environment? roll back in seconds.

Let the agent go full YOLO. The blast radius stops at the container wall.

## Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose (v2.0+)
* Python 3.7+
* **Tested on**: Ubuntu (amd64/arm64), macOS (Apple Silicon), Windows (WSL2 + Docker Desktop)

> **Windows / WSL2:** run `scripts/setup-wsl-crashdump-policy.ps1` once to stop WSL from writing gigabyte crash dumps when a sandboxed browser/agent segfaults.

## TL;DR

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/shiritai/sanity-gravity.git
cd sanity-gravity

# 2. (Optional) Build locally instead of pulling from GHCR
# ./sanity-cli build

# 3. Launch the sandbox (Auto-pulls missing images from GHCR!)
./sanity-cli up -v ag-xfce-kasm --password mysecret
```

Open **https://localhost:8444** — your sandboxed desktop is ready!

* **Username**: your host OS username
* **Password**: `mysecret` (default: `antigravity`)

> The self-signed certificate warning on localhost is expected. Click through it.

## Why Sanity-Gravity?

AI agents run arbitrary code. One rogue `rm -rf /` and your host is toast. Sanity-Gravity confines every agent action inside a disposable Docker container while streaming a full desktop experience to your browser — or providing just a minimal SSH shell when that's all you need.

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                                       |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host Isolation**             | Even if an agent runs `rm -rf /` or downloads malware, only the sandbox is destroyed. Your host stays untouched.  |
| **Full GUI Desktop**           | Ubuntu 24.04 + XFCE4 + KasmVNC. Agents operate browsers and GUI apps just like a human would.                    |
| **Headless CLI Agents**        | Minimal images for Gemini CLI, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and OpenCode - no desktop overhead, just SSH.           |
| **Out-of-the-Box**             | Pre-installed with Antigravity IDE, Google Chrome, and Git. Zero setup time.                                      |
| **Seamless Disk I/O**          | Smart UID/GID mapping. No root-owned file disasters after host volume mounts.                                     |
| **Multi-Instance**             | Parallel isolated sandboxes. Host ports are auto-allocated when unspecified (zero conflicts), or can be set manually. |
| **Container Snapshots**        | Freeze your configured environment (installed software, active logins) into a new image branch.                   |
| **IDE Safe Upgrade**           | Built-in `dpkg-divert` protection prevents `apt upgrade` from breaking Antigravity or Chrome.                     |
| **SSH Agent Proxy**            | Use host SSH keys inside containers — no private key copying required.                                            |
| **Multi-Arch**                 | All images support both `amd64` and `arm64`.                                                                      |

## Choose Your Sandbox

Every image is described by a tag: **`{base-image-}agent-desktop-connector`**. Pick one that matches your use case. The base image is optional and defaults to Ubuntu; other bases are prefixed (e.g. `debian-ag-xfce-kasm`):

| I want to...                     | Tag              | Connect via                |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
| Run Antigravity IDE in browser   | `ag-xfce-kasm`   | `https://localhost:8444`   |
| Run Antigravity IDE via VNC      | `ag-xfce-vnc`    | `localhost:5901`           |
| Use Gemini CLI in a terminal     | `gc-none-ssh`    | `ssh -p 2222 ...`         |
| Use Gemini CLI with a desktop    | `gc-xfce-kasm`   | `https://localhost:8444`   |
| Use Claude Code in a terminal    | `cc-none-ssh`    | `ssh -p 2222 ...`         |
| Use Claude Code with a desktop   | `cc-xfce-kasm`   | `https://localhost:8444`   |
| Use OpenAI Codex in a terminal   | `cx-none-ssh`    | `ssh -p 2222 ...`         |
| Use OpenAI Codex with a desktop  | `cx-xfce-kasm`   | `https://localhost:8444`   |
| Use OpenCode in a terminal       | `oc-none-ssh`    | `ssh -p 2222 ...`         |
| Use OpenCode with a desktop      | `oc-xfce-kasm`   | `https://localhost:8444`   |
| Use OpenCode Desktop in browser  | `od-xfce-kasm`   | `https://localhost:8444`   |

> **First time?** Start with **`ag-xfce-kasm`** — it gives you the full desktop experience via your browser.

> **Heads-up:** `gc` (Gemini CLI) lost its free tier on 2026-06-18 and now requires a paid Gemini API key / Code Assist license. New users should prefer **`agy`** (Antigravity CLI), Google's official successor — already shipped here.

There are **178 valid combinations** in total (default Ubuntu base, plus a `debian-`-prefixed variant of every tag). See [Modular Tag System](docs/tags.md) for the full matrix, dimension model, and constraint rules.

## Advanced Features

### IDE Management & Safe Upgrade

Sanity-Gravity provides a robust defense mechanism against accidental IDE or browser uninstallation caused by `apt upgrade`.

- **Host side**: `sanity-cli` manages container lifecycles. Maintenance commands **auto-inject the latest protection script** into the target container, ensuring backward compatibility with legacy snapshots.
- **Container side**: `gravity-cli` (built-in) safely manages Antigravity IDE and Google Chrome via `dpkg-divert`, guaranteeing their `--no-sandbox` privilege protections survive system updates.

#### From the Host

```bash
# Safely update IDE to the latest package version
./sanity-cli ide update --name sanity-gravity

# Nuclear option: full wipe + clean reinstall to fix persistent crashes
./sanity-cli ide reinstall --name sanity-gravity
```

#### Inside the Container

```bash
sudo gravity-cli update-ide     # Equivalent to 'ide update'
sudo gravity-cli reinstall-ide  # Equivalent to 'ide reinstall'
```

### SSH Agent Proxy

A built-in proxy bridges your host's SSH Agent Socket into the container. This enables `git push` / `git pull` inside the sandbox using your host's private keys — without ever copying them.

`./sanity-cli up` handles this automatically. For manual control:

```bash
./sanity-cli proxy status       # Check proxy and active connections
./sanity-cli proxy setup        # Restart / fix proxy
./sanity-cli proxy remove       # Terminate proxy
```

### Multi-Instance

Run unlimited parallel sandboxes using `--name`:

```bash
# Launch a second instance
./sanity-cli up -v ag-xfce-kasm --name dev-02 --workspace /tmp/dev02
```

**Zero-Conflict Guarantee**: `sanity-cli` auto-allocates free host ports when using a custom name. Check your assigned ports via `./sanity-cli status`. Target a specific instance with `--name` (e.g. `./sanity-cli down --name dev-02`).

### Container Snapshots

Freeze your configured environment — installed software, login sessions, custom settings — into a reusable image.

1. **Create a snapshot**:
   ```bash
   ./sanity-cli snapshot --name my-base-env --tag my-verified-state:v1
   ```

2. **Launch from the snapshot**:
   ```bash
   ./sanity-cli up -v ag-xfce-kasm --name new-experiment --image my-verified-state:v1
   ```

## SSH Access

All images — including GUI variants — expose SSH on port `2222` by default. This enables:

- **Headless automation** — script tasks from the host without opening a desktop
- **Port forwarding** — `ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 -p 2222 $USER@localhost`
- **Remote development** — VS Code Remote SSH, JetBrains Gateway

```bash
ssh -p 2222 $USER@localhost
```
