# OpenCode: Additional agent-specific setup
# Skills synchronization is handled by the central sync-agent-resources script.
# This hook only handles agent-specific tasks that don't fit the central framework.
#
# Persist the OpenCode autoupdate opt-out where SSH sessions can see it.
# The Dockerfile's ENV OPENCODE_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE only reaches
# supervisord children (the GUI path); sshd builds a fresh PAM
# environment, so on the headless variants the env var never arrives.
# The documented config-file switch covers every entry path instead.
# Seed-once: the file belongs to the user and may be edited later
# (providers, theme, ...), so an existing config is left untouched.
