# OpenCode Desktop: Additional agent-specific setup
# Skills synchronization is handled by the central sync-agent-resources script.
# This hook only handles agent-specific tasks that don't fit the central framework.
#
# Opt the OpenCode Desktop app out of self-update wherever it can see it.
# The app is root-owned under /opt/OpenCode, so an auto-update could never
# succeed for the sandbox user and would only add startup noise. The
# documented config-file switch (~/.config/opencode/opencode.json with
# "autoupdate": false) covers every entry path, including GUI launches that
# never inherit an ENV. Seed-once: the file belongs to the user and may be
# edited later (providers, theme, ...), so an existing config is untouched.
